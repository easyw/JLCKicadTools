1) parameters: switch from DIR name to project name
2) teh script is relying on an XML net file... a BOM needs to be generated to create/update a XML file before launching the tool
3) the tool is creating a CPL placement file with only JLC code parts; this is fine to have a list of ONLY JLC parts for assembling w JLC service
   (also rotation will be adjusted following the csv DB)
4) TBD a script to remove Paste pads from the JLC DNF SMD footprints
